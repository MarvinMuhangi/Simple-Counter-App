# Simple Counter App
This is a simple counter app. It took five days to design and build it to finish. I'm a beginner at this you can tell.

This simple counter app is a very basic counter.

It has three buttons, increase, reset, and decrease.

Increase -> This button, when clicked, increases the number displayed on the screen by one.

Decrease -> This button, when clicked, decreases the number displayed on the screen by one.

Reset -> This button resets the number displayed on the screen to zero.

This is all this app does. It is a simple counter app.
